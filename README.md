# Dynamic-Cropping-and-Preprocessing
# Image Cropping and Video Preprocessing Toolkit

This repository contains a set of scripts designed for cropping images and performing manual preprocessing tasks for videos and frames. The cropping scripts offer two approaches:
1. **Goal Frame Cropping**: Dynamically adjusts cropping boundaries based on a reference (goal) frame.
2. **Predefined Cropping**: Uses fixed dimensions and margins for consistent cropping.

Additionally, the repository includes tools for manual tasks such as frame extraction, resolution adjustment, and basic preprocessing.

## Purpose

This project aims to:
- **Automate Cropping**:
  - Dynamically crop images using a goal frame as reference or predefined dimensions.
- **Perform Manual Preprocessing**:
  - Extract video frames, adjust resolutions, and prepare data for downstream tasks.

## Features

### **Cropping Mechanism**
- **Goal Frame Cropping**:
  - Detects shoulder landmarks in a goal frame to calculate cropping boundaries dynamically.
- **Predefined Cropping**:
  - Crops images based on predefined width, height, and optional margins.

### **Manual Preprocessing**
- Extract frames from videos.
- Adjust image or video resolutions.
- Perform basic preprocessing tasks.

## Examples

  The repository includes example images from the AI4Bharat Sign Language dataset Include.
